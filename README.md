# Random Quote Generator

Renders a random quote object from an array to the page and changes the
background color to a random color. Subsequent quotes can be requested by
clicking a button. If a request for a new quote is not made, the next quote
will automatically be shown after thirty seconds. Each quote will be rendered
randomly at least one time before quotes from the array are repeated.
